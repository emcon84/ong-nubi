This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Custom Styles

I used the emotion styled and styled components libraries for Nextjs

```bash
npm install --save @emotion/react
# or
yarn add @emotion/react
```

## Components with Material

The potential that Material design has with its components for React was used, this to be able to make the drop-down sidebar for the new recipes.

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

```

## React Icons

The React Icons library was used for some non-custom Icons. For the vast majority, it was generated in the icons folder, as SVG vectors

``` bash
    npm install react-icons --save
```
